# OpenGL Graphics Programming Showcase

This repository contains a series of graphics programming techniques implemented using OpenGL, showcasing my skills in real-time rendering, optimization, and visual effects.

## Features

This project demonstrates several advanced OpenGL techniques, including:

- **Instancing**: Efficiently renders multiple instances of objects to optimize performance.
- **Face Culling**: Removes back-facing polygons to improve rendering efficiency and maintain visual consistency.
- **Lighting**: Implements dynamic lighting effects, including ambient, diffuse, and specular reflections.
- **Model Loading**: Loads and renders complex 3D models, using Assimp or a similar library.
- **Blending**: Adds transparency effects to objects, allowing for smooth visual transitions.
- **Early Depth Testing**: Optimizes rendering by discarding unnecessary pixels before fragment processing.
- **Cubemap**: Adds reflective environments with a skybox, enhancing the realism of the scene.
- **Geometry Shader (Exploding Effect)**: Uses geometry shaders to create an "exploding" visual effect, splitting objects into fragments.
